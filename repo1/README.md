## Introduction

The data that I have access to is a subset of the raw data used in the original report, containing only the recipes and reviews posted since 2008, since the original data is quite large.

RAW_recipes.csv contains the recipes, while RAW_interactions.csv contains the reviews.

Question to investigate: Is there a correlation between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?

People should care about this dataset bacause a lot of people cook at home, and some of the information from this dataset (nutritional facts, rating, ingredients, etc.) can serve as a huge factor when choosing what to cook for a meal. Specifically, people should care about my question because people can decide what kind of meals to make given their time constraints, should there exist a relationship.

##### Number of rows: 83782

##### Relevant Columns: 

minutes: number of minutes it takes to prepare each recipe

calories (#): number of calories for each recipe 

sodium: the amount of sodium used for each recipe 

rating: average rating for each recipe

## Cleaning and EDA

### Cleaning Data
Here are the steps I took to clean the data:
1. Left merge the recipes and rating datasets together so that the cooking times and the ratings are in the same dataset
2. Replace all ratings of 0 with np.nan in the merged dataset, as rating of 0 means the user did not rate.
3. Find the average rating per recipe as a Series and add this Seriesback to the merged recipes dataset
4. Convert the tags column from strings to lists
5. Convert nutrition column from strings to lists, then separate a list of nutritional labels to several different columns. This helps to detect if the missingness of a column has to do with nutritional columns.
6. Remove nutrition column as nutritional labels (calories, total sugar, etc.) are separated into different columns
7. Move rating to the last column
8. Convert nutritional labels from strings to floats (Quantify the labels)

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/cooking-time-uni.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>


As you can see, most of the recipes take no more than 150 minutes to prepare. For the recipes that take no more than 150 minutes to prepare, most of the them take about 20 to 50 minutes to prepare. However, as shown on the graph, some can take as long as 10000000 to 100000000 minutes to prepare.

### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/calories-min-scatter.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

As you can see, the bottom-left corner of the graph takes is the most dense part of the scatterplot. Notice that there are some data points at the top-left corner of the plot, meaning that the recipe does not have a lot of calories even though it takes a long time to prepare that recipe. On the other hand, there are some data points at the bottom-right corner of the plot, meaning that the recipe has a lot of calories even though it does not take a long time to prepare that recipe.

Note: Recipes that take more than 500000 minutes to prepare or has more than 500000 calories are not on the scatterplot

### Aggregate Analysis

The table below shows the average calories for different cooking time and rating intervals. This table can be used as a source to explore if the average cooking time and the rating has anything to do with the number of calories of a recipe.

The table below shows the average cooking time for different rating intervals. Notice that recipes that have ratings higher than 3 tend to have longer average cooking time in this table. Also notice that recipes without a rating tend to take significantly longer time to prepare comparing to those with ratings.

| (1.0, 2.0]    |   94.7684 |

| (3.0, 4.0]    |  112.166  |

## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis
I found out that there are 3 columns with missing values in my dataset:

|             |   number  of missing entries |
|:------------|-----------------------------:|
| name        |                            1 |
| description |                           70 |
| rating      |                         2609 |


I believe that the description column is NMAR, since people tend to ignore the description when rating a recipe (unless the experience of making/tasting the recipe is so unforgettable that a user would want to comment). Additional data like time it takes to write a description may be able to explain the missingness.

### Missingness Dependency

I was wondering if the missingness of the rating column has anything to do with the number of calories. 
<iframe src="assets/cal-missing.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We got a P-value of 5.821920986766768e-09 using K-S Statistic. Our result implies that the missingness of the rating column depends on calories (#) column.

I was also wondering if the missingness of the rating column has anything to do with sodium (PDV) column. 
<iframe src="assets/sodium-missing.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We got a P-value of 0.11517155899608289 using K-S Statistic. Our result implies that the missingness of the rating column does not depend on calories (#) column.

## Hypothesis/Permutation Testing

Null Hypothesis: In the population, the average cooking time of recipes with rating more than 3 and that of recipes with rating no more than 3 have the same distribution, and the observed differences in our samples are due to random chance.

Alternate Hypothesis: In the population, the average cooking time of recipes with rating more than 3 is longer than that of recipes with rating no more than 3, on average. The observed differences in our samples cannot be explained by random chance alone.

Test Statistic: Signed difference in group means

Significance Level: 5%

This statistic is reasonable because not only did I want to know if there exists a difference between the 2 disdtributions, I also wanted to know if one has a lower mean than the other.

5% is a common choice for significance level.

<iframe src="assets/permutation-test-rating-min.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Under the null hypothesis, the chance of us seeing differences as extreme as the observed statistic is close to 60% (way higher than the alpha value of 5%). Thus, we failed to reject the null hypothesis.
